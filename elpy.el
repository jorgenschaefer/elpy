;; The Emacs Lisp Python Environment in Emacs

;; Elpy is an Emacs package to bring powerful Python editing to Emacs.
;; It combines a number of existing Emacs packages, and uses one of a
;; selection of Python packages for code introspection.

;; To use, you need to install not only this package, but a few Python
;; packages as well. See the installation instructions on the wiki.

;; Documentation is available there as well.

;; https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/elpy/wiki
