Installation
============

Elpy is available on Melpa, the most straightforward way to install it is to use `use-package`:

.. code-block:: elisp

  (use-package elpy
    :ensure t
    :init
    (elpy-enable))

Elpy relies on some python packages that need to be installed as well:

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install jedi rope flake8 autopep8 yapf black

For other installation alternatives, see the `documentation`_.

.. _documentation: https://elpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html#installation


Quickstart
==========

Once installed, Elpy will automatically provide code completion, syntax error highlighting and code hinting (in the modeline) for python files. Elpy offers a lot of features, but the following keybindings should be enough to get started:

- :kbd:`C-c C-c` evaluates the current python script (or region if something is selected) in an interactive python shell. The python shell is automatically displayed aside of your script.
- :kbd:`C-RET` evaluates the current statement (current line plus the following nested lines).
- :kbd:`C-c C-z` switches between your script and the interactive shell.
- :kbd:`C-c C-d` displays documentation for the thing under cursor. The documentation will pop in a different buffer, that can be closed with :kbd:`q`.

Please have a look at the documentation at `Readthedocs`_ if you want to know more about what Elpy can do.
