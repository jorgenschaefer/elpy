Quick Installation
==================

First, install the required Python packages:::

  # Either of these
  pip install rope
  pip install jedi
  # flake8 for code checks
  pip install flake8
  # importmagic for automatic imports
  pip install importmagic
  # and autopep8 for automatic PEP8 formatting
  pip install autopep8
  # and yapf for code formatting
  pip install yapf


Evaluate this in your ``*scratch*`` buffer:

.. code-block:: lisp

  (require 'package)
  (add-to-list 'package-archives
               '("elpy" . "https://jorgenschaefer.github.io/packages/"))


Then run ``M-x package-refresh-contents`` to load the contents of the
new repository, and ``M-x package-install RET elpy RET`` to install
elpy.

Finally, add the following to your ``.emacs``:

.. code-block:: lisp

  (package-initialize)
  (elpy-enable)

Done.
