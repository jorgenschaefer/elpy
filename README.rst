==========================
Elpy, the Emacs Python IDE
==========================

Elpy is an Emacs package to bring powerful Python editing to Emacs.
It combines and configures a number of other packages, both written in
Emacs Lisp as well as Python. Elpy is fully documented at `Readthedocs`_.

.. _Readthedocs: https://elpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html

IMPORTANT NOTE: Looking for a maintainer
========================================

I find myself (@galaunay, current maintainer), unable to maintain Elpy at the moment, and probably for a while.
If you are interested in getting involved in Elpy, please contact me by mail, **the project definitely needs you** !

In the meantime, I will keep an eye on the PRs to integrate any fix and/or new features proposed, but I will definitely not be able to treat the issues in a satisfying manner.
If you are stuck with an issue, please have a look at the `documentation`_, there is a lot of answers there. 
@gfederix also made some bug fixing in his `fork`_, so you can try using this version of Elpy.

Installation
============

Elpy is available on Melpa, the most straightforward way to install it is to use `use-package`:

.. code-block:: elisp

  (use-package elpy
    :ensure t
    :init
    (elpy-enable))

For other installation alternatives, see the documentation section `Installation`_.

.. _Installation: https://elpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html#installation


Quickstart
==========

Once installed, Elpy will automatically provide code completion, syntax error highlighting and code hinting (in the modeline) for python files. Elpy offers a lot of features, but the following keybindings should be enough to get started:

- :kbd:`C-c C-c` evaluates the current python script (or region if something is selected) in an interactive python shell. The python shell is automatically displayed aside of your script.
- :kbd:`C-RET` evaluates the current statement (current line plus the following nested lines).
- :kbd:`C-c C-z` switches between your script and the interactive shell.
- :kbd:`C-c C-d` displays documentation for the thing under cursor. The documentation will pop in a different buffer, that can be closed with :kbd:`q`.

Please have a look at the documentation at `Readthedocs`_ if you want to know more about what Elpy can do.
