Quickstart
==========

Once installed, Elpy will automatically provide code completion, syntax error highlighting and function signature (in the modeline) for python files.

Useful keybindings
------------------

Elpy has quite a lot of keybindings, but the following ones should be enough to get you started:

`C-c C-c` evaluates the current script (or region if something is selected) in an interactive python shell. The python shell is automatically displayed aside of your script (if not already there).

`C-RET` evaluates the current statement (current line plus the following nested lines).

`C-c C-z` switches between your script and the interactive shell.

`C-c C-d` displays documentation for the thing under cursor (function or module). The documentation will pop in a different buffer, that can be closed with `q`.

Elpy offers a lot of features, including code navigation, debugging, testing, refactoring, profiling and support for virtual environments.
Feel free to explore the documentation, everything is there !
