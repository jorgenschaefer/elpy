Projects
========

Elpy supports the notion of *projects*, a related collection of files
under a common directory. This common directory is called the
:index:`project root`. A number of Elpy's commands work on all files
inside the project root.

.. command:: elpy-find-file
   :kbd: C-c C-f

   Find a file in the current project. This uses a search-as-you-type
   interface for all files under the project root.

   A prefix argument enables "do what I mean" mode. On an import
   statement, it will try to open the module imported. Elsewhere in a
   file, it will look for an associated test or implementation file,
   and if found, open that. If this fails, either way, it will fall
   back to the normal find file in project behavior.

   If the current file is called ``foo.py``, then this will search for
   a ``test_foo.py`` in the same directory, or in a ``test`` or
   ``tests`` subdirectory. If the current file is already called
   ``test_foo.py``, it will try and find a ``foo.py`` nearby.

   This command uses `find-file-in-project`_ under the hood, so see
   there for more options.

.. _find-file-in-project: https://github.com/technomancy/find-file-in-project

.. command:: elpy-rgrep-symbol
   :kbd: C-c C-s

   Search the files in the current project for a string. By default,
   this uses the symbol at point. With a prefix argument, it will
   prompt for a regular expression to search.

   This is basically a ``grep -r`` through the project.

In addition to these two commands, :command:`elpy-check` also supports
optionally checking all files in the current project.

Elpy's idea of the project root and which files belong to a project
and which don't can be influenced as well.

.. command:: elpy-set-project-root

   Set the current project root directory. This directory should
   contain all files related to the current project.

.. option:: elpy-project-ignored-directories

   When Elpy searches for files in the current project, it will ignore
   files in directories listed here.

.. option:: elpy-project-root-finder-functions

   To find the project root, Elpy can utilize a number of heuristics.
   With this option, you can configure which are used.

To configure Elpy specifically for a single project, you can use
Emacs' `Directory Variables`_. Elpy provides a simple interface to
this.

.. command:: elpy-set-project-variable

   Set or change the value of a project-wide variable. With a prefix
   argument, the value for the variable is removed.

   This only takes effect in new buffers.

.. _Directory Variables: https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Directory-Variables.html


Completion
==========

When you type Python code, Elpy will try and figure out possible
completions and provide them in a suggestion window. If Elpy doesn't
do so automatically, you can force it to complete right where you are.

.. command:: elpy-company-backend
   :kbd: M-TAB

   Provide completion suggestions for a completion at point.

You can use cursor keys or :kbd:`M-n` and :kbd:`M-p` to scroll through
the options, :kbd:`RET` to use the selected completion, or :kbd:`TAB`
to complete the common part.

On any completion option, :kbd:`C-d` or :kbd:`<f1>` will display a
temporary window with documentation. :kbd:`C-w` will display a
temporary window showing the source code of the completion to get some
context.

Elpy uses `Company Mode`_ for the completion interface, so its
documentation is a good place for further information.

.. _Company Mode: https://company-mode.github.io/

.. option:: elpy-get-info-from-shell

    If t, use the shell to gather docstrings and completions. Normally elpy
    provides completion and documentation using static code analysis (from
    jedi). With this option set to t, elpy will add the completion candidates
    and the docstrings from the associated python shell. This allows to have
    decent completion candidates and documentation when the static code analysis
    fails. the static code analysis fails.


Navigation
==========

Elpy supports some advanced navigation features inside Python
projects.

.. command:: elpy-goto-definition
   :kbd: M-.

   Go to the location where the identifier at point is defined. This
   is not always easy to make out, so the result can be wrong. Also,
   the backends can not always identify what kind of symbol is at
   point. Especially after a few indirections, they have basically no
   hope of guessing right, so they don't.

.. command:: elpy-goto-definition-other-window
   :kbd: C-x 4 M-.

   Same as `elpy-go-to-definition` (with the same caveats) but goes to
   the definition of the symbol at point in other window, if defined.

.. command:: pop-tag-mark
   :kbd: M-*

   Go back to the last place where :kbd:`M-.` was used, effectively
   turning :kbd:`M-.` and :kbd:`M-*` into a forward and backward
   motion for definition lookups.

.. command:: elpy-occur-definitions
   :kbd: C-c C-o

   Search the buffer for a list of definitions of classes and functions.


If you use an Emacs version superior to 25, elpy will define the
necessary backends for the `xref`_ package.

.. command:: xref-find-definitions
   :kbd: M-.

   Find the definition of the identifier at point.

.. command:: xref-find-definition-other-window
   :kbd: C-x 4 .

   Like :kbd:`M-.` but switch to the other window.

.. command:: xref-find-definition-other-frame
   :kbd: C-x 5 .

   Like :kbd:`M-.` but switch to the other frame.

.. command:: xref-pop-marker-stack
   :kbd: M-,

   Go back to the last place where :kbd:`M-.` was used, effectively
   turning :kbd:`M-.` and :kbd:`M-,` into a forward and backward
   motion for definition lookups.

.. command:: xref-find-references
   :kbd: M-?

   Find references for an identifier of the current buffer.

.. command:: xref-find-apropos
   :kbd: C-M-.

   Find all meaningful symbols that match a given pattern.

.. _xref: https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Xref.html


Interactive Python
==================

Emacs can run a Python interpreter in a special buffer, making it much easier to
send code snippets over. Elpy provides additional functionality to seamlessly
work with interactive Python in a style similar to ESS_.

.. _ESS: http://ess.r-project.org

Interpreter Setup
-----------------

Elpy uses the Python interpreter setup from the Emacs ``python`` package. This
section briefly summarizes some common setups; add the one you need to your
``.emacs`` file. Note that the code below (and Elpy in general) require at least
Emacs 24.4.

Use the Python standard interpreter (default):

.. code-block:: cl

   (setq python-shell-interpreter "python"
         python-shell-interpreter-args "-i")

Use Jupyter console (recommended for interactive Python):

.. code-block:: cl

   (setq python-shell-interpreter "jupyter"
         python-shell-interpreter-args "console --simple-prompt"
         python-shell-prompt-detect-failure-warning nil)
   (add-to-list 'python-shell-completion-native-disabled-interpreters
                "jupyter")

Use IPython:

.. code-block:: cl

   (setq python-shell-interpreter "ipython"
         python-shell-interpreter-args "-i --simple-prompt")

Note that various issues with plotting have been reported when running IPython 5
in Emacs under Windows. We recommend using Jupyter console instead.

If you have an older version of IPython and the above code does not work for
you, you may also try:

.. code-block:: cl

   (setenv "IPY_TEST_SIMPLE_PROMPT" "1")
   (setq python-shell-interpreter "ipython"
         python-shell-interpreter-args "-i")

   As an IPython_ user, you might be interested in the `Emacs IPython
   Notebook`_ or an `Elpy layer`_ for Spacemacs_, too.

.. _IPython: http://ipython.org/
.. _Emacs IPython Notebook: https://tkf.github.io/emacs-ipython-notebook/
.. _Elpy layer: https://github.com/rgemulla/spacemacs-layers/tree/master/%2Blang/elpy
.. _Spacemacs: http://spacemacs.org/

The Shell Buffer
----------------

.. command:: elpy-shell-switch-to-shell
   :kbd: C-c C-z

   Switch to buffer with a Python interpreter running, starting one if
   necessary.

   By default, Elpy tries to find the root directory of the current project
   (git, svn or hg repository, python package or projectile project) and
   starts the python interpreter here. This behaviour can be suppressed
   with the option ``elpy-shell-use-project-root``.

.. command:: elpy-shell-toggle-dedicated-shell

   By default, python buffers are all attached to a same python shell
   (that lies in the `*Python*` buffer), meaning that all buffers and
   code fragments will be send to this shell.
   `elpy-shell-toggle-dedicated-shell` attaches a dedicated python shell
   (not shared with the other python buffers) to the current python buffer.
   To make this the default behavior (like the deprecated option
   `elpy-dedicated-shells` did), use the following snippet:

.. code-block:: lisp

   (add-hook 'elpy-mode-hook (lambda () (elpy-shell-toggle-dedicated-shell 1)))

.. command:: elpy-shell-set-local-shell

   Attach the current python buffer to a specific python shell (whose name is
   asked with completion).
   You can use this function to have one python shell per project, with:

.. code-block:: lisp

   (add-hook 'elpy-mode-hook (lambda () (elpy-shell-set-local-shell (elpy-project-root))))

.. command:: elpy-shell-kill
   :kbd: C-c C-k

   Kill the associated python shell.

.. command:: elpy-shell-kill-all
   :kbd: C-c C-K

   Kill all active python shells.


Evaluating code fragments
-------------------------

Elpy provides commands to send the current Python statement (:kbd:`e`), function
definition (:kbd:`f`), class definition (:kbd:`c`), top-level statement
(:kbd:`s`), group of Python statements (:kbd:`g`), cell (:kbd:`w`), region
(:kbd:`r`), or buffer (:kbd:`b`) to the Python shell for evaluation. These
commands are bound to prefix :kbd:`C-c C-y`, followed by the single character
indicating what to send; e.g., :kbd:`C-c C-y e` sends the Python statement at
point.

Each of the commands to send code fragments to the shell has four variants, one
for each combination of: whether or not the point should move after sending
("step"), and whether or not the Python shell should be focused after sending
("go"). Step is activated by :kbd:`C-`, go by :kbd:`S-`. For example:

.. command:: elpy-shell-send-statement
   :kbd: C-c C-y e

   Send the current statement to the Python shell and keep point position. Here
   statement refers to the Python statement the point is on, including
   potentially nested statements and, if point is on an if/elif/else clause, the
   entire if statement (with all its elif/else clauses).

.. command:: elpy-shell-send-statement-and-step
   :kbd: C-c C-y C-e

   Send the current statement to the Python shell and move point to first
   subsequent statement.

   Also bound to :kbd:`C-RET`.

.. command:: elpy-shell-send-statement-and-go
   :kbd: C-c C-y E

   Send the current statement to the Python shell, keeping point position, and
   switch focus to the Python shell buffer.

.. command:: elpy-shell-send-statement-and-step-and-go
   :kbd: C-c C-y C-S-E

   Send the current statement to the Python shell, move point to first
   subsequent statement, and switch focus to the Python shell buffer.

Elpy provides support for sending multiple statements to the shell.

.. command:: elpy-shell-send-group-and-step
   :kbd: C-c C-y O

   Send the current or next group of top-level statements to the Python shell
   and step. A sequence of top-level statements is a group if they are not
   separated by empty lines. Empty lines within each top-level statement are
   ignored.

   If the point is within a statement, send the group around this statement.
   Otherwise, go to the top-level statement below point and send the group
   around this statement.

.. command:: elpy-shell-send-codecell-and-step
   :kbd: C-c C-y W

   Send the current code cell to the Python shell and step. A code cell is a
   piece of code surrounded by special separator lines; see below. For example,
   you can insert two lines starting with ``##`` to quickly send the code
   in-between.

.. option:: elpy-shell-codecell-beginning-regexp

   Regular expression for matching a line indicating the beginning of a code
   cell. By default, ``##.*`` is treated as a beginning of a code cell, as are
   the code cell beginnings in Python files exported from IPython or Jupyter
   notebooks (e.g., ``# <codecell>`` or ``# In[1]:``).

.. option:: elpy-shell-cell-boundary-regexp

   Regular expression for matching a line indicating the boundary of a cell
   (beginning or ending). By default, ``##.*`` is treated as a cell boundary, as
   are the boundaries in Python files exported from IPython or Jupyter notebooks
   (e.g., ``# <markdowncell>``, ``# In[1]:``, or ``# Out[1]:``).

   Note that :option:`elpy-shell-codecell-beginning-regexp` must also match the
   cell boundaries defined here.

The functions for sending the entire buffer have special support for avoiding
accidental code execution, e.g.:

.. command:: elpy-shell-send-region-or-buffer
   :kbd: C-c C-y r

   Send the the active region (if any) or the entire buffer (otherwise) to the
   Python shell and keep point position.

   When sending the whole buffer, this command will also escape any uses of the
   ``if __name__ == '__main__'`` idiom, to prevent accidental execution of a
   script. If you want this to be evaluated, pass a prefix argument with
   :kbd:`C-u`.

   Also bound to :kbd:`C-c C-c`.

The list of remaining commands to send code fragments is:

.. command:: elpy-shell-send-top-statement
   :kbd: C-c C-y s
.. command:: elpy-shell-send-top-statement-and-go
   :kbd: C-c C-y S
.. command:: elpy-shell-send-defun
   :kbd: C-c C-y f

   :kbd: C-c C-y R
.. command:: elpy-shell-send-buffer
   :kbd: C-c C-y b
.. command:: elpy-shell-send-buffer-and-go
   :kbd: C-c C-y B
.. command:: elpy-shell-send-top-statement-and-step
   :kbd: C-c C-y C-s
.. command:: elpy-shell-send-top-statement-and-step-and-go
   :kbd: C-c C-y C-S-S
.. command:: elpy-shell-send-defun-and-step
   :kbd: C-c C-y C-f
.. command:: elpy-shell-send-defun-and-step-and-go
   :kbd: C-c C-y C-S-F

.. command:: elpy-shell-send-buffer-and-step
   :kbd: C-c C-y C-b
.. command:: elpy-shell-send-buffer-and-step-and-go
   :kbd: C-c C-y C-S-B

Shell feedback
--------------

When package `eval-sexp-fu`_ is loaded and ``eval-sexp-fu-flash-mode`` is
active, the statements sent to the shell are briefly flashed after running an
evaluation command, thereby providing visual feedback.

.. _eval-sexp-fu: https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EvalSexpFu

.. option:: elpy-shell-echo-input

   Whenever a code fragment is sent to the Python shell, Elpy prints it in the
   Python shell buffer (i.e., it looks as if it was actually typed into the
   shell). This behavior can be turned on and off via the custom variable
   `elpy-shell-echo-input` and further customized via
   ``elpy-shell-echo-input-cont-prompt`` (whether to show continuation prompts
   for multi-line inputs) and ``elpy-shell-echo-input-lines-head`` /
   ``elpy-shell-echo-input-lines-tail`` (how much to cut when input is long).

.. option:: elpy-shell-echo-output

   Elpy shows the output produced by a code fragment sent to the shell in the
   echo area when the shell buffer is currently invisible. This behavior can be
   controlled via `elpy-shell-echo-output` (never, always, or only when shell
   invisible). Output echoing is particularly useful if the custom variable
   :option:`elpy-shell-display-buffer-after-send` is set to ``nil`` (the default
   value). Then, no window is needed to display the shell (thereby saving screen
   real estate), but the outputs can still be seen in the echo area.

.. option:: elpy-shell-display-buffer-after-send

   Whether to display the Python shell after sending something to it (default
   ``nil``).


Syntax Checking
===============

Whenever you save a file, Elpy will run a syntax check and highlight
possible errors or warnings inline.

.. command:: elpy-flymake-next-error
   :kbd: C-c C-n
.. command:: elpy-flymake-previous-error
   :kbd: C-c C-p

   You can navigate between any error messages with these keys. The
   current error will be shown in the minibuffer.

Elpy uses the built-in `Flymake`_ library to find syntax errors on the
fly, so see there for more configuration options.

.. _Flymake: https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/flymake/index.html#Top


.. command:: elpy-check
   :kbd: C-c C-v

   Alternatively, you can run a syntax check on the current file where
   the output is displayed in a new buffer, giving you an overview and
   allowing you to jump to the errors from there.

   With a prefix argument, this will run the syntax check on all files
   in the current project.

.. option:: python-check-command

   To change which command is used for syntax checks, you can
   customize this option. By default, Elpy uses the ``flake8``
   program, which you have to install separately. The
   :command:`elpy-config` command will prompt you to do this if Elpy
   can't find the program.

   It is possible to create a single virtual env for the sole purpose
   of installing ``flake8`` in there, and then simply link the command
   script to a directory inside your :envvar:`PATH`, meaning you do
   not need to install the program in every virtual env separately.


Documentation
=============

Elpy provides a single interface to documentation.

.. command:: elpy-doc
   :kbd: C-c C-d

   When point is on a symbol, Elpy will try and find the documentation
   for that object, and display that. If it can't find the
   documentation for whatever reason, it will try and look up the
   symbol at point in pydoc. If it's not there, either, it will prompt
   the user for a string to look up in pydoc.

   With a prefix argument, Elpy will skip all the guessing and just
   prompt the user for a string to look up in pydoc.

If the `autodoc` module is enabled (not the case by default) the
documentation is automatically updated with the symbol at point or the
currently selected company candidate.

.. option:: elpy-autodoc-delay

   The idle delay in seconds until documentation is updated automatically.


Debugging
=========

Elpy provides an interface to `pdb`_, the builtin Python debugger.
Note that this interface is only available for Emacs 25 and above.

.. _pdb: https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html

.. command:: elpy-pdb-debug-buffer
   :kbd: C-c C-g g

   Run pdb on the current buffer. If no breakpoints has been set using
   :command:`elpy-pdb-toggle-breakpoint-at-point`, the debugger will
   pause at the beginning of the buffer. Else, the debugger will pause
   at the first breakpoint. Once pdb is started, the `pdb commands`_
   can be used to step through and look into the code evaluation.

   With a prefix argument :kbd:`C-u`, ignore the breakpoints and
   always pause at the beginning of the buffer.

.. _pdb commands: https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html#debugger-commands

.. command:: elpy-pdb-toggle-breakpoint-at-point
   :kbd: C-c C-g b

   Add (or remove) a breakpoint on the current line. Elpy adds a red
   circle to the fringe to indicate the presence of a breakpoint. You
   can then use :command:`elpy-pdb-debug-buffer` to start pdb and
   pause at each of the breakpoints.

   With a prefix argument :kbd:`C-u`, remove all the breakpoints.

.. command:: elpy-pdb-break-at-point
   :kbd: C-c C-g p

   Run pdb on the current buffer and pause at the cursor position.

.. command:: elpy-pdb-debug-last-exception
   :kbd: C-c C-g e

   Run post-mortem pdb on the last exception.


Testing
=======

Testing is an important part of programming. Elpy provides a central
interface to testing, which allows for a good workflow for tests.

Elpy's test interface is built around Emacs' `compilation framework`_.
Elpy will run test commands as a compilation job, with all the
advantages this brings.

.. _compilation framework: https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Compilation.html

.. command:: elpy-test
   :kbd: C-c C-t

   Start a test run. This uses the currently configured test runner to
   discover and run tests. If point is inside a test case, the test
   runner will run exactly that test case. Otherwise, or if a prefix
   argument is given, it will run all tests.

.. command:: elpy-set-test-runner

   This changes the current test runner. Elpy supports the standard
   unittest discovery runner, the Django discovery runner, nose and
   py.test. You can also write your own, as described in :ref:`Writing
   Test Runners`.

   Note on Django runners: Elpy tries to find `manage.py` within your project
   structure. If it's unable to find it, it falls back to `django-admin.py`.
   You must set the environment variable :envvar:`DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` accordingly.


This enables a good workflow. You write a test and use :kbd:`C-c C-t`
to watch it fail. You then go to your implementation file, for example
using :kbd:`C-u C-c C-f`, and make the test pass. You can use a key
bound to ``recompile`` (I use :kbd:`<f5>` for this) to just re-run
that one test. Once that passes, you can use :kbd:`C-c C-t` again to
run all tests to make sure they all pass as well. Repeat.

For an even more automated way, you can use `tdd.el`_, which will run
your last compile command whenever you save a file.

.. _tdd.el: https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/emacs-tdd/

.. _virtualenvwrapper.el: https://github.com/porterjamesj/virtualenvwrapper.el


Refactoring
===========

Elpy supports various forms of refactoring Python code.

.. command:: elpy-multiedit-python-symbol-at-point
   :kbd: C-c C-e

   Edit all occurrences of the symbol at point at once. This will
   highlight all such occurrences, and editing one of them will edit
   all. This is an easy way to rename identifiers.

   If the backend does not support finding occurrences (currently only
   Jedi does), or if a prefix argument is given, this will edit
   syntactic occurrences instead of semantic ones. This can match more
   occurrences than it should, so be careful. You can narrow the
   current buffer to the current function using :kbd:`C-x n d` to
   restrict where this matches.

   Finally, if there is a region active, Elpy will edit all
   occurrences of the text in the region.


.. command:: elpy-format-code
   :kbd: C-c C-r f

   Format code using the available formatter.

   This command formats code using `yapf`_ , `autopep8`_ or `black`_
   formatter. If a region is selected, only that region is formatted.
   Otherwise current buffer is formatted.

   `yapf`_ and `autopep8`_ can be configured with style files placed in
   the project root directory (determined by ``elpy-project-root``).

.. _autopep8: https://github.com/hhatto/autopep8
.. _yapf: https://github.com/google/yapf
.. _black: https://github.com/ambv/black


.. command:: elpy-refactor
   :kbd: C-c C-r r

   Run the Elpy refactoring interface for Python code.

   This command uses `rope`_ package and provides various refactoring
   options depending on the context.

.. _rope: https://github.com/python-rope/rope


Django
======

Elpy has basic Django support such as parsing either `manage.py` or `django-admin.py` (If it
does not find `manage.py` it falls back to `django-admin.py`) for command completion assistance.
Can also start `runserver` automatically and you can give an ip address and port.

.. command:: elpy-django-command
   :kbd: C-c C-x c

   Choose what command you'd like to run via `django-admin.py` or `manage.py`.

.. command:: elpy-django-runserver
   :kbd: C-c C-x r


   Start the development server command, `runserver`. Default arguments are `127.0.0.1` for
   ip address and `8000` for port. These can be changed via ``elpy-django-server-ipaddr`` and
   ``elpy-django-server-port``.


Profiling
=========

Elpy allows one to profile asynchronously python scripts using `cProfile`.

.. command:: elpy-profile-buffer-or-region

   Send the current buffer or region to the profiler and display the result with
   ``elpy-profile-visualizer``.
   The default visualizer is `snakeviz`_, a browser-based graphical profile viewer that can be installed with `pip install snakeviz`.
   If the profiling fails, the python error output is displayed.
.. _snakeviz: https://jiffyclub.github.io/snakeviz/
